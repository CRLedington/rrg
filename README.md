## What is the Red River Gorge?
1. Red River Gorge National Geological Area is a National Natural Landmark which is a part of the Daniel Boone National Forest.
2. The Red River Gorge is famous around the world for climbing and hiking.
3. The Gorge was almost turned into a man-made lake in the 1960s with the proposal of a dam.
